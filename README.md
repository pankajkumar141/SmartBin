# SMARTBIN
The smart dustbin enabled with cloud and app 
control is a significant technological innovation that promises to 
revolutionize waste management. With the ability to automatically 
sort and compact waste, as well as providing real-time information 
on waste levels and collection schedules, this system offers a 
more efficient and effective solution to the challenges of waste 
management. The app control feature provides convenience and 
ease of use to the users, enabling them to monitor the status of the 
dustbin and schedule waste collections from the comfort of their 
mobile devices. This technology has the potential to reduce waste 
overflow and improve sanitation in cities and towns, ultimately 
leading to a cleaner and healthier environment. The adoption of 
this smart dustbin technology is a step towards a more 
sustainable future, and it is encouraging to see such innovative 
solutions being developed to tackle the pressing issue of waste 
management
